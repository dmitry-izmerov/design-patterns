Pattern: Prototype

Goal:
Define type of objects with prototype-instance and then to create new objects basing on this (copying) prototype.

Using:
For copies creation of defined object.

Examples of using:
- if classes, instances of which its necessary to create, is defined in runtime;
- for problem escaping of building of classes hierarchy, factories or parallel classes hierarchies;
- if class instances can be in one of possible states.
