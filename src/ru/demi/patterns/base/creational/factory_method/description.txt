Pattern: Factory method

Goal:
To build interface, which create object. Classes that implement this interface solve by self what object
of what class to create.

Using:
It is used for delegation of object creation to another class.

Examples of using:
- It isn't known in advance what objects of what classes it is necessary will create.
- Class is built in the way that objects which are created by it have properties of concrete class.
