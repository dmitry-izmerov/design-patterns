Pattern: Singleton

Goal:
To guarantee, that class will have only one instance of another class and this instance will be accessible from
any point of application.

Using:
For creation of single instance of the class.

Examples of using:
- It is necessary to have only one instance of the class, which is accessible for all clients.
- Single instance should be inherited by creation of subclass and clients have the opportunity to work with
  class-descendant without modification of itself code.
