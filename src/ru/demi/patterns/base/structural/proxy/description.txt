Pattern: Proxy

Goal:
For replacement another object and access control to it.

Using:
Provide access control to the object.

Examples of using:
- if it is necessary to refer to object in the different way from usual reference;
- remote proxies - local object instead of object in another address space;
- virtual proxies - create "heavy objects" if its necessary;
- protected proxies - access control to pointed object;
- smart reference - replace usual pointer for counting of objects, etc.
