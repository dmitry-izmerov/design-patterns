Pattern: Composite

Goal:
Compose objects in structures of tree kind, got objects allow clients uniformly interact both
with individual and with composite objects.

Using:
For grouping of small components in bigger, which can form the basis for larger structures.

Examples of using:
- for presentation of "part-whole" hierarchy;
- if we want clients uniformly interact both with separate and composite objects;
