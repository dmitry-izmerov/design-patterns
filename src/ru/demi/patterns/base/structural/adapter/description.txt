Goal:
Convert current interface to necessary interface.

Using:
Provide work of different classes together, which interfaces are incompatible.

Examples of using:
- if interface does not meet our needs;
- we need the class, which should interact with other classes, that our class don't know about or that have no
  any connections with our class;
