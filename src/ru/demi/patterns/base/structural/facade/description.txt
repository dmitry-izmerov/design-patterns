Pattern: Facade

Goal:
Give uniform interface instead of several interfaces of submodules (components).

Using:
For define high level interface, which simplifies using of submodules.

Examples of using:
- isolating of clients from subsystems' components;
- there is necessity to decouple subsystems from clients.
