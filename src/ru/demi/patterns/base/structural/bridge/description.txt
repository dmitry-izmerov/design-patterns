Pattern: Bridge

Goal:
Separate abstraction from implementation in order to we can change these ones independently.

Using:
For getting advantages of hierarchy without the loss of flexibility.

Examples of using:
- to prevent strict binding of abstraction to implementation;
- we want in future to expand abstraction and implementation by subclasses;
- if changes of implementation shouldn't affect on clients of abstraction;
