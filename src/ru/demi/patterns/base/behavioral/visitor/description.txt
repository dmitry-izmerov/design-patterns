Pattern: Visitor

Goal:
Describing of actions, which execute with each objects in a structure.

Using:
Describe operations, which execute with each object from a structure and allow
to define a new operation without change of these objects.

Examples of using:
- if a structure has objects of many classes with different interfaces and its necessary
  to execute a operations with them, which depend on specific classes;
- if its necessary to execute unrelated operations over objects, which are parts of the structure
  and we don't want to add these operations in classes;
- if classes are rarely changed but new operations are often added over the structure.
