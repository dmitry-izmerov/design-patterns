Pattern: State

Goal:
Behaviour management of the object depending on the state.

Using:
Allow to us to manage the behaviour of the object depending on the inner state of the object.

Examples of using:
- if behaviour of the object depends on the its state and changes in runtime;
- when there are many conditional statements in code, when the choice of the conditional branch
 depends on the state of the object.
