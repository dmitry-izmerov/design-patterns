Pattern: Mediator

Goal:
Encapsulate interaction of many objects.

Using:
Define object, which encapsulate interaction of many objects and provide weak coupling between objects.

Examples of using:
- connections between objects are complex and clearly defined;
- if you cannot reuse an object since it exchanges information with other objects;
- behavior that is divided between several classes should be easy to configure without
creating classes.
