Pattern: Chain of responsibility

Goal:
Collect object-clients in chain and transfer of request using it.

Using:
It helps to escape binding of request sender to recipient and gives possibility to process this request by several
objects.

Examples of using:
- reduce connection (object should not know who processes his request);
- additional flexibility in the distribution of responsibilities between objects.
