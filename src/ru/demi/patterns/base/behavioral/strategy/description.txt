Pattern: Strategy

Goal:
Interchangeability of a set of algorithms.

Using:
Defining a set of classes that encapsulate some algorithm and providing the interchangeability of them.

Examples of using:
- if there are several related classes which differ in their behavior;
- if its necessary to have several behaviors;
- if there is data in the class about which client shouldn't know;
- if class has large amount of possible behaviors defined by conditional statements.
